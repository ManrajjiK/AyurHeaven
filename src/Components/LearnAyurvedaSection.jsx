          Ayurveda, meaning "the science of life", is one of the worldâ€™s oldest holistic healing systems. 
          Developed more than 5,000 years ago in India, itâ€™s based on the belief that health and wellness 
          depend on a delicate balance between the mind, body, and spirit. ðŸŒ¿ðŸ§˜

          In Ayurveda, there are three main life energies or doshas: <b>Vata (Air)</b>, <b>Pitta (Fire)</b>, 
          and <b>Kapha (Earth & Water)</b>. Understanding your dosha helps guide diet, lifestyle, and treatments.

          Ayurveda emphasizes <b>Dinacharya</b> (daily routine) and <b>Ritucharya</b> (seasonal routine) to live 
          in harmony with nature. From tongue scraping in the morning to oil massage (Abhyanga) and herbal teas â€“ 
          every ritual is designed to keep you balanced. âœ¨
